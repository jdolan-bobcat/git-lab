Answer 1: 2.17.1
Answer 2: user.name=John Dolan
user.email=dolan@ohio.edu
Answer 3: I get a usage command and a list of common git commands and what they each do
Answer 4: On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

        new file:   readme.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        answers.md
        answers.md.save
 Which showing me what is yet to added. I had gone ahead and added the readme.md before recording this step - the earlier call to status showed me the readme.md as untracked as well.
